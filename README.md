# 🔬 Project: Drug Discovery Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
# 🚀 Completed as part of a hands-on session by Intellipaat

In this project, I worked on a drug discovery dataset to classify compounds as effective or ineffective using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm widely used in the pharmaceutical industry.

# 🔍 Key Highlights:

-- Performed data preprocessing and feature selection for optimal model performance.

-- Trained an SVM classifier to distinguish between active and inactive compounds.

-- Tuned hyperparameters such as kernel type, C, and gamma to improve accuracy.

-- Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-- Gained practical insight into how machine learning accelerates drug development pipelines.

This project deepened my understanding of SVM and its real-world applications in healthcare and biotech.
